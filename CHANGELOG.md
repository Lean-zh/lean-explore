N/A

## [0.3.0] - 2025-06-09

### Added
- Implemented batch processing for `search`, `get_by_id`, and `get_dependencies` methods across the stack, allowing them to accept lists of requests for greater efficiency.
- The **API Client** (`lean_explore.api.client`) now sends batch requests concurrently using `asyncio.gather` to reduce network latency.
- The **Local Service** (`lean_explore.local.service`) was updated to process lists of requests serially against the local database and FAISS index.
- The **MCP Tools** (`lean_explore.mcp.tools`) now expose this batch functionality and provide list-based responses.
- The **AI Agent** instructions (`lean_explore.cli.agent`) were updated to explicitly guide the model to use batch calls for more efficient tool use.

## [0.2.2] - 2025-06-06

### Changed
- Updated minimum Python requirement to `>=3.10`.
